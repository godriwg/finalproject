<P class="MsoNormal">The Poison Center is an emergency telephone hotline that is 
 available to both the public and health care providers 24 hours a day, 7 days a 
 week. The Poison Center is in a unique position to identify potential public 
 health risks, new drugs of abuse trends, and potential bioterrorism activity. 
In  this presentation, the Ms. Mercurio-Zappala discusses various topics from 
 holiday toxins to what’s new in the news such as the opioid 
epidemic.<o:p></o:p></P>&nbsp;<A name="procedures"><B>Body</B></A>

 Mental Hygiene, affiliated with American Association of Poison Control Centers. 
 They have staff of 20 pharmacists, nurses, and PAs. The staff is training in 
 house for over 6 months and national certification. There are also medical 
 backups, including certified medical toxicologists. <o:p></o:p></P>
<P class="MsoNormal">The Poison Center serves the public and professionals. NYS

 50%. Increase population to cover 12 million residents. Provides 24/7 telephone 
 services to public and professionals. Provide inpatient consultation and care 
in  3 major hospitals. They also have a weekly outpatient clinic.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P class="MsoNormal">Anyone could call the poison center, from both public and 
 health care providers. In 2013, 92321 calls were answered. Exposures mostly 
were  in children. The most common request is from the administration of public 
 health. The most common cause is cosmetic/personal care, analgesics, household 
 cleaners, foreign bodies, topical, vitamins, pesticide/rodenticides, 
 arts/crafts, antibiotics, and antihistamines. <o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
<P class="MsoNormal">Anyone calls expected to answer the following questions: 
 name, age, weight; what was ingested and how much; when the ingestion occurred; 
 if the patient has any symptoms. Specialist may make recommendations based on 
 the history of the ingestion and how the patient is at the time of the call. 
 Follow up calls may be performed.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P class="MsoNormal">What is a poison? Any substance which may cause harm if 
 swallowed, inhaled or splashed. There are many types of exposures, and signs 
and  symptoms of toxic ingestion including unexplained nausea or vomiting, 
abdominal  cramps etc. What to do? Call the PCC and be prepared to give the 
information.  Management of exposures: gently remove any substances. Wash the 
skin with mild  soap. Inhalation, open all doors and windows, avoid inhaling the 
fumes,  immediately remove the patient to fresh air. Ocular exposures, rinse 
eyes with  room temperature water for 5 minutes. <o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
<P class="MsoNormal">The most toxic agents in the acute setting are calcium 
 channel blockers, oral hypoglycemic, iron, oven cleaners/drain cleaners, lamp 
 oil/furniture oil, and anti freeze/windshield wiper fluid. </P>
<P class="MsoNormal">Bees, spiders and snakes. Keep the victim calm, and wash 
 the area. Plants can kill. Dieffenbachia is toxic if ate. 
<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>Christmas  Holy leaves are toxic; they are used in folk 
medicine. Mistletoe berries may  cause GI distress. Adulterated tea or 
concentrated extracts cause hallucination.  Poinsettia may cause irritation. 
</P>
<P class="MsoNormal">Laundry pods if ingested cause coughing and choking, eye 
 and oral irritation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, drowsiness and lethargy, 
 respiratory distress, unresponsiveness and seizures. Carbon monoxide is toxic. 
 It is odorless, colorless and tasteless. It is not heavier or lighter than 
 oxygen: it mixes well in the atmosphere. Carbon monoxide can pass through the 
 dry wall between rooms. If the flame is orange, it indicates carbon monoxide. 
If  symptoms occur, open windows, leave for fresh air, and go to the emergency 
 department. Treatment is 1000% oxygen.</P><A name="results"> <BR><A name="conclusion"><B>Summary</B><BR></A>
