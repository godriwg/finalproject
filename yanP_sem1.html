Mental Hygiene, affiliated with American Association of Poison Control Centers. 
They have staff of 20 pharmacists, nurses, and PAs. The staff is training in 
house for over 6 months and national certification. There are also medical 
backups, including certified medical toxicologists. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Poison Center serves the public and professionals. NYS

50%. Increase population to cover 12 million residents. Provides 24/7 telephone 
services to public and professionals. Provide inpatient consultation and care in 
3 major hospitals. They also have a weekly outpatient clinic.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Anyone could call the poison center, from both public and 
health care providers. In 2013, 92321 calls were answered. Exposures mostly were 
in children. The most common request is from the administration of public 
health. The most common cause is cosmetic/personal care, analgesics, household 
cleaners, foreign bodies, topical, vitamins, pesticide/rodenticides, 
arts/crafts, antibiotics, and antihistamines.
<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Anyone calls expected to answer the following questions: 
name, age, weight; what was ingested and how much; when the ingestion occurred; 
if the patient has any symptoms. Specialist may make recommendations based on 
the history of the ingestion and how the patient is at the time of the call. 
Follow up calls may be performed.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What is a poison? Any substance which may cause harm if 
swallowed, inhaled or splashed. There are many types of exposures, and signs and 
symptoms of toxic ingestion including unexplained nausea or vomiting, abdominal 
cramps etc. What to do? Call the PCC and be prepared to give the information. 
Management of exposures: gently remove any substances. Wash the skin with mild 
soap. Inhalation, open all doors and windows, avoid inhaling the fumes, 
immediately remove the patient to fresh air. Ocular exposures, rinse eyes with 
room temperature water for 5 minutes.
<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The most toxic agents in the acute setting are calcium 
channel blockers, oral hypoglycemic, iron, oven cleaners/drain cleaners, lamp 
oil/furniture oil, and anti freeze/windshield wiper fluid. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Bees, spiders and snakes. Keep the victim calm, and wash 
the area. Plants can kill. Dieffenbachia is toxic if ate. <span>&nbsp;</span>Christmas 
Holy leaves are toxic; they are used in folk medicine. Mistletoe berries may 
cause GI distress. Adulterated tea or concentrated extracts cause hallucination. 
Poinsettia may cause irritation. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Laundry pods if ingested cause coughing and choking, eye 
and oral irritation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, drowsiness and lethargy, 
respiratory distress, unresponsiveness and seizures. Carbon monoxide is toxic. 
It is odorless, colorless and tasteless. It is not heavier or lighter than 
oxygen: it mixes well in the atmosphere. Carbon monoxide can pass through the 
dry wall between rooms. If the flame is orange, it indicates carbon monoxide. If 
symptoms occur, open windows, leave for fresh air, and go to the emergency 
department. Treatment is 1000% oxygen.</p>
